    <h1>Typhoon Lagoon</h1>
    <p>One of the best things about the disney world water parks is that they both have cool themes.
      Disney's typhoon lagoon is set in a former tropical pradise that has been destroyed by a devastating typhoon. There's a wave pool surrounded by sand that sets off huge waves every couple minutes. It really feels like you're at the beach! There is also a lazy
      river where you float around, passing various ruins and wrecked boats. You can also swim with the sharks and ride various watercoasters.
