  <!--MY FAVORITE DISNEY WORLD PARK-->
  <body>
    <h1>Hollywood Studios</h1>
    <p>Hollywood Studios is probably my favorite out of all the Disney World parks. It's atmoushphere is breathtaking, and the Hollywood themed rollercoasters/shows are thrilling.
      The best attractions are rock and roller coaster, tower of terror, toy story midway mania, fantasmic, indiana jones stunt spectacular, lights motors action!, and muppet vision 3D.
      Hollywood Studiod doesn't have much must eat food, it is more about the exhilerating attractions and enjoyable atmosphere.
